# This is a joke twitter bot to encourage a friend and to give me more python experience

The idea of this bot is that it will like and retweet everything my friend says
in order to promote and encourage them to have fun. I also want it to be able to
use gifs, I'm thinking Jean Ralphio or something in that vain.

To-do
=====
1. ~~Set up git repo~~
2. ~~get api credentials~~
3. Create a tweet listener
4. Create response list
5. Figure out how to pull gifs
6. improve "random" quote pull, seems to be puling the same ones
7. heroku deployment, apsheduler not behaving as I want.
